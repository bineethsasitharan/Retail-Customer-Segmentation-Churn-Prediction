Retail Customer Segmentation &amp; Churn Prediction

💼 Customer churn poses significant challenges for retail businesses as they struggle to comprehend customer behavior and identify potential churners. Lack of insights into the underlying reasons for customer attrition hinders targeted retention efforts, leading to further customer losses. The main objective of this study is to propose an effective approach for churn prediction in the retail sector by combining RFM analysis with machine learning algorithms, leveraging primarily transactional data. 📊🛒

📊 RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores are calculated for each customer before the study's end date, providing valuable insights into their recent transaction activity, purchase frequency, and monetary value. These scores serve as essential features for subsequent machine learning modeling. Once the RFM scores are calculated, customers are then segmented based on their RFM scores. By segmenting customers, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their customer base and identify high-value, loyal customers as well as those at risk of churning.🛍️🔍

🎯The target value for prediction models is the customer segment and churn metric, indicating whether a customer is likely to make a transaction in the next three months following the RFM analysis or not. This task falls under the category of multi-class and multi-output classification. 🎯🎯 By leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, the study aims to identify customer segments at higher risk of churning.🚀

📈 Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, the F1 score is used as the primary evaluation metric instead of accuracy. Among the various models, the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving a perfect F1 score of 100% for segmentation and 99% for churn prediction, along with high accuracy, precision, and recall.🔮💪

💻🌐 Moreover, successfully deployed the churn prediction model using Streamlit, making it easily accessible and interactive for businesses. This web application allows companies to harness the predictive capabilities of our model with ease, empowering them to identify customers at risk of churning and implement targeted retention strategies. 🌐📱💪

📚💡📊 The combination of RFM analysis and machine learning algorithms provides a powerful tool for retail businesses to predict customer churn and take strategic actions to improve customer retention. This research highlights the significance of data-driven approaches in understanding customer behavior and optimizing business strategies to achieve sustained growth and success. 🌟
