Retail Customer Segmentation &amp; Churn Prediction

💼 Customer churn poses significant challenges for retail businesses as they struggle to comprehend customer behavior and identify potential churners. Lack of insights into the underlying reasons for customer attrition hinders targeted retention efforts, leading to further customer losses. The main objective of this study is to propose an effective approach for churn prediction in the retail sector by combining RFM analysis with machine learning algorithms, leveraging primarily transactional data. 📊🛒

🎯 RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores are calculated for each customer before the study's end date, providing valuable insights into their recent transaction activity, purchase frequency, and monetary value. These scores serve as essential features for subsequent machine learning modeling. The target value for prediction models is the customer segment and churn metric, indicating whether a customer is likely to make a transaction in the next three months following the RFM analysis or not. By leveraging machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine, the study aims to identify customer segments at higher risk of churning. The results obtained from the machine learning models demonstrate that companies can predict customer churn with a high level of confidence. Armed with this predictive capability, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers effectively. Personalized offers, improved customer service, targeted marketing campaigns, and more can be implemented to minimize customer attrition. 📈🛍️

🚀 The combination of RFM analysis and machine learning algorithms provides a powerful tool for retail businesses to predict customer churn and take strategic actions to improve customer retention. This research highlights the significance of data-driven approaches in understanding customer behavior and optimizing business strategies to achieve sustained growth and success. 🎯📊
